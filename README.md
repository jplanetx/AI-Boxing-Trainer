## üìä What You'll See

### Main Interface
- **Left/Right Arm Stats**: Punch counts, speed scores, and punch types
- **Form Analysis**: Real-time technique grades (A-F) and feedback
- **Performance Metrics**: FPS counter and pose detection status
- **3D Pose Visualization**: Enhanced landmark display with depth

### Form Feedback System
- **Technique Scoring**: 0-100% score based on biomechanical analysis
- **Real-time Tips**: Specific suggestions for improving form
- **Grade System**: A-F grades for instant performance feedback

## üîß Technical Details

### Punch Classification Algorithm
The system uses 3D trajectory analysis to distinguish punch types:

1. **Uppercut**: High vertical movement component (>70%)
2. **Hook**: Horizontal lateral movement with high width-to-depth ratio
3. **Jab**: Lead hand straight punch (stance-dependent)
4. **Cross**: Rear hand straight punch with hip rotation

### Form Analysis Metrics
- **Shoulder Angle**: Hip-shoulder-elbow alignment
- **Hip Rotation**: Core engagement measurement
- **Elbow Extension**: Full extension for straights, proper angles for hooks/uppercuts
- **Wrist Alignment**: Proper striking surface orientation

### 3D Pose Tracking
- **Model**: MediaPipe BlazePose GHUM (Heavy complexity)
- **Landmarks**: 33 3D points with visibility confidence
- **Smoothing**: 5-frame temporal smoothing for stability
- **Performance**: 30 FPS target on modern hardware

## üéØ Training Tips

### Getting Started
1. **Position yourself**: Stand 6-8 feet from camera, full body visible
2. **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting, avoid backlighting
3. **Background**: Plain background works best for pose detection
4. **Stance**: Start in orthodox (left foot forward) or southpaw stance

### Improving Accuracy
- Keep movements controlled and deliberate
- Return to guard position between punches
- Focus on proper form over speed initially
- Use the form feedback to refine technique

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Could not open camera"**
- Check if camera is connected and not used by another app
- Try different camera_id values (0, 1, 2...)
- Restart the application

**Low FPS or lag**
- Reduce model_complexity in `PoseTracker` (2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 0)
- Lower camera resolution
- Close other applications using CPU/camera

**Inaccurate punch detection**
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Check camera positioning (full body visible)
- Calibrate detection thresholds in `punch_classifier.py`

**Form analysis not working**
- Verify pose detection is active (green "POSE DETECTED" indicator)
- Check landmark visibility scores
- Ensure proper stance and camera angle

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
