# AI Boxing Trainer - Archon Project Status Update
**Project ID**: 9b90da96-99d4-443d-a070-f192c7657ecb  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-21  
**Status**: Development Phase - Model Research & Testing Complete

## Executive Summary

The AI Boxing Trainer project has progressed through extensive testing and research phases, uncovering fundamental limitations with MediaPipe BlazePose for boxing applications. **Critical discovery**: MediaPipe has a 90% accuracy ceiling and struggles with boxing movements due to training data bias (yoga/dance vs combat sports). 

**Next Phase**: Implementation of MoveNet Lightning as the primary pose detection system, based on research showing superior performance for athletic movements.

## Research Findings Summary

### MediaPipe BlazePose Analysis
- **Accuracy Ceiling**: ~90% relative to IMU-based systems
- **Training Bias**: Optimized for yoga/dance, poor for combat sports
- **Processing Speed**: 15-25ms per frame (adequate but not optimized)
- **Occlusion Handling**: Poor when arms cross body
- **Key Limitation**: "Both arms moving" during single-arm punches due to pose coherence assumptions

### MoveNet Lightning Advantages
- **Sports Optimization**: Trained specifically for athletic movements
- **Processing Speed**: <10ms per frame (3x faster than MediaPipe)
- **Boxing Compatibility**: Better handling of rapid, independent arm movements
- **Occlusion Recovery**: Superior temporal tracking during arm crossings

### Camera Setup Requirements
- **Optimal Distance**: 2.5-3.5 meters from subject
- **Angle**: 45-degree angle (not pure side view) for trajectory capture
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1280x720, preferably 1920x1080
- **Frame Rate**: Minimum 30 FPS, optimal 60 FPS for boxing
- **Lighting**: Consistent, bright lighting critical (window light + room lighting)
