# Punch Detection Analysis & Next Steps

## Current State Summary

### What We've Built & Tested

#### ✅ **Successfully Implemented**
- **MediaPipe BlazePose integration** - Real-time pose tracking
- **Multiple detection algorithms** - Angle-based, velocity-based, position-based  
- **Punch history with visual decay** - Sequence tracking foundation
- **Label persistence system** - Stable feedback for evaluation
- **Multi-modal detection** - Jabs, crosses, hooks with different detection methods

#### ❌ **Core Issues Identified**

##### 1. **Single Camera Limitations**
- **Depth perception missing** - Cannot distinguish forward punches from arm raises
- **Angle ambiguity** - Same arm angle can represent different punch types
- **Occlusion problems** - Body blocks hand visibility during hooks
- **2D projection errors** - 3D movements compressed to 2D create false readings

##### 2. **Detection Inconsistency**
- **31 console detections vs 5 logged** - Shows fundamental instability
- **False positive rate too high** - Normal movements trigger punch detection
- **Hook detection poor** - Wide movements lose tracking accuracy
- **Threshold sensitivity** - Too strict misses punches, too loose creates noise

##### 3. **MediaPipe Architectural Limits**
- **Designed for general pose** - Not optimized for rapid boxing movements
- **Confidence scoring unreliable** - Doesn't correlate with actual punch accuracy
- **Temporal smoothing conflicts** - Stability vs responsiveness tradeoff
