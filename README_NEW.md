# AI Boxing Trainer 🥊

AI-powered boxing trainer using MediaPipe pose detection for real-time punch analysis, form feedback, and performance tracking.

## Features

- **Real-time Pose Detection**: 3D pose tracking using MediaPipe BlazePose GHUM
- **Punch Classification**: Automatic detection and classification of jabs, crosses, hooks, and uppercuts
- **Form Analysis**: Real-time feedback on boxing technique and form
- **Performance Tracking**: Count punches, track scores, and monitor improvement
- **Training Modes**: Support for heavy bag training and other boxing scenarios

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Webcam/camera
- Windows 10/11 (primary platform)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jplanetx/AI-Boxing-Trainer.git
cd AI-Boxing-Trainer
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

**Simple Mode (Basic punch counting):**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Advanced Mode (Full AI trainer with form analysis):**
```bash
python ai_trainer/main.py
```

**Heavy Bag Optimizer:**
```bash
python run_robust_trainer.py
```
